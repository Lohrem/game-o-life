# Conway's Game of Life, A project for Lambda School


## What is Conway's Game of Life?
The Game of Life was contructed by John Conway in the 1970s. It's main premise is for cellular automation. A single cell  
at any given time can only be alive or dead, in order for a cell to be either be alive or dead it must follow some rules:  
1. If the cell has less than two neighbors, it dies from underpopulation and if it has more than three, it dies from overpopulation.
2. If a cell has either two or three cells, it lives on to the next generation of cells.
3. A dead cell can be brought back to life if it has exactly three live neighbors.

## Extras
Something I would've liked to have added would be for the user to input their name and from that, the grid would fill in with cells that are alive writing out their name.
